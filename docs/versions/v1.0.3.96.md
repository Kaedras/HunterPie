## <new>New</new> Plugins System

HunterPie now supports plugins. Plugins have access to **everything** HunterPie handles, including player data, monster data, game events. If you're interested in developing your own extensions, you can find an example [here](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie.Plugins/blob/master/TwitchIntegration/main.cs).

## <new>New</new> Monster Widget

- Added ailment buildup, timer and part health text format.

Special String       | Description                    |
:-------------------:|:------------------------------:|
{Current}            | Current bar value              |
{Max}                | Maximum bar value              |
{Percentage}         | Current value / Maximum Value  |

Special strings are strings that will be replaced when HunterPie renders the text. They are case-sensitive and need to be written exactly as shown in the table above.

#### Examples:
- **{Current}/{Max} ({Percentage}%)**: 500/1000 (50%)
- **{Percentage}%**: 50%
