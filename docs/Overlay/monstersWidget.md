## Design structure

## Monster bar modes
The monster widget has 5 different bar modes, each one has it's own behaviour and characteristics. You can switch between them by either going to HunterPie settings tab and clicking on the `Monster bar mode` box or pressing the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> hotkey.

### Show all monsters at once
This mode shows all monsters at once, it's the default mode.

![Show all monsters at once](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402557384209203200/732293041594957955/unknown.png)

### Show all monsters but highlight my target
This mode shows all monsters but decreases the opacity of the monsters that aren't your target.

### Show only hunted monster
This mode is basically a boss bar, it is always centrelized and it's width is higher than the default bars. Having no targets will hide **ALL** monster bars.

### Show all but hide inactive monsters after X seconds
It's similar to the first mode, but it hides the monster that haven't been damaged after 15 seconds.

### Show all until a monster is selected
This mode is similar to the [Show only hunted monster](#show-only-hunted-monster), but when there's no target, all monsters are displayed.

## Targeting a monster
There are two ways to target a monster, both of them have it's pros and cons:

### Targeting a monster from map (Default)
This is the default way to target a monster, when you get in a quest the game will automatically target your quest objective for you, but when you are in expeditions/Guiding Lands you **must** open your map and target the monster by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> on their icon or by clicking their investigation gauge on bottom left of your map.

> **Note:** If there are more than 1 monster as the quest objective, the game will only automatically target the first one, so you'll have to manually target the next one.

> **Note 2:** If you haven't found the monster in map yet, the game will only automatically target it for you after you've discovered them.

### Targeting a monster using in-game lockon
This option must be turned on in your `HunterPie Settings -> Monster` tab. It will make HunterPie set the target based on which monster you have locked-on. This is the most intuitive way to target a monster, however has some limitations:
- In order for the lockon work properly, you need to set the `Target settings` in your game to **Large Monsters Only**, otherwise small monsters will mess with the lockon system.
- Captured monsters will mess with the lockon, this is a known issue that is still in progress to fix. However it is fixed after the monster despawn.

> **Note:** For a better experience with the lock-on, I strongly recommend these settings:<br>

## Monster Parts & Ailments

<warning>WARNING: THIS FEATURE DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY IF YOU'RE NOT THE PARTY HOST, IT'S A GAME LIMITATION AND I CANNOT FIX IT.</warning>

### Parts & Removable Parts

Monster parts are, well... Parts of the monster that can be damaged! See the design structure below:

![partStructureDesign](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402557384209203200/732323920685957180/monster-part-structure.png)

Parts that can be broken have a break threshold shown by the side of the flinch counter. See the image below:

![flinchBreakExplanation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402557384209203200/732326495732760595/counter-exp.png)

- **n/x+:** This means there are multiple break thresholds, it will break for the first time at `x` flinches.
- **n/x:** This means there are only one break threshold, it will break when you flinch that part `x` times.
- **n**: This means you cannot break this part, it is just a flinch counter.

### Ailments

Monster ailments have the same design as the part displays, however some ailments have two states: Buildups and Timers.

- **Buildups:** Some ailments like paralysis, poison, blast, etc, have what's called a "Buildup", whenever you hit the monster, it may increase the buildup value by a bit, whenever the buildup hits the maximum value the monster is affected by that abnormality and a timer might start depending on the ailment.
- **Timer:** A timer that counts down until the ailment effect is over.
- **Counter:** Counts how many time you've inflicted that ailment on the monster.

### Settings

Disabling Ailments will cause the parts to use all the available display, same thing happens when you disable parts and removable parts.

### Understanding parts columns and rows

Some monster have a lot of parts and ailments, HunterPie has a limit of how many parts it can show at once, it can be configured in your `HunterPie settings -> Monsters`. 

Columns and rows are dynamic, which means they will resize depending on how many displays it needs to fit in the parts/ailments display.

#### Columns
Adding more columns will display more parts when there's an overflow in the last column.

### Rows
Adding more rows will make each column display more parts at each column.

> Example: 2 columns & 8 rows<br>
